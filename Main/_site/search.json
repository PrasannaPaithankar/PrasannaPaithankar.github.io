The setup successfully passes statistical tests without any post-processing. The generator can be potentially used for quantum communication and cryptography.

A simple MRR geometry consists of one or two straight waveguides and circular or bent waveguides. Due to huge potential and versatility, we provide a comprehensive review on microring resonators that encompasses from material selection to applications and various configurations.

We have derived transmission field amplitudes of such cascaded system without graphene. The deposition of graphene on the PNF region produces an optoelectronically tunable transmission with an appreciable extinction by harnessing the unique advantages of graphene and cascaded resonator system. The proposed device can be potentially used for sensing and modulator applications.
