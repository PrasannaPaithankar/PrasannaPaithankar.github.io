I am currently a junior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, pursuing a BTech+MTech in Computer Science and Technology.

My general research interests lie in field of photonic based computation, pseudorandomness and statistical learning theory. I am an undergraduate researcher at Fiber Optics and Nano and Quantum Photonics Group (FONQP), Advanced Photonics Laboratory (APL), IIT Kharagpur, under the guidance of [Professor Shailendra Varshney](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=7KsrPeEAAAAJ&hl=en).

I also make financial softwares and scripts for aiding Chartered Accountants and Tax professionals and one would find me either swimming at TSG pool or in APL.
