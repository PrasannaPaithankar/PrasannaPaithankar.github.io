I am currently a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, pursuing a BTech+MTech in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am pursuing my Bachelor's Thesis under the supervision of [Professor Partha Pratim Chakrabarti](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~ppchak/) and [Professor Shailendra Varshney](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=7KsrPeEAAAAJ&hl=en). The focus is on optimizing the performance of computational electromagnetics (and similar domains in physics) using AI.

I also work on pseudorandomness and random number generator architectures at [Fiber Optics and Nano and Quantum Photonics (FONQP) Group](https://fonqp.github.io), Advanced Photonics Laboratory (APL), IIT Kharagpur.
